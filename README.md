# EnchantKit

An early stage (and unstable) API for interacting with Abracadabra's various product. Current it is only a POC!

The SDK uses [Viem](https://github.com/wagmi-dev/viem), and much of the repository setup is inspired by their setup! If something looks smart, you'll probably be able to find something similar there!
